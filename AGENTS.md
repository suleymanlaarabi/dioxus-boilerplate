# UI with RSX

```rust
rsx! {
	div {
		class: "container", // Attribute
		color: "red", // Inline styles
		width: if condition { "100%" }, // Conditional attributes
		"Hello, Dioxus!"
	}
	// Prefer loops over iterators
	for i in 0..5 {
		div { "{i}" } // use elements or components directly in loops
	}
	if condition {
		div { "Condition is true!" } // use elements or components directly in conditionals
	}

	{children} // Expressions are wrapped in brace
	{(0..5).map(|i| rsx! { span { "Item {i}" } })} // Iterators must be wrapped in braces
}
```

# Components

Components are the building blocks of apps

* Component are functions annotated with the `#[component]` macro.
* The function name must start with a capital letter or contain an underscore.
* A component re-renders only under two conditions:
	1.  Its props change (as determined by `PartialEq`).
	2.  An internal reactive state it depends on is updated.

```rust
#[component]
fn Input(mut value: Signal<String>) -> Element {
	rsx! {
		input {
            value,
			oninput: move |e| {
				*value.write() = e.value();
			},
			onkeydown: move |e| {
				if e.key() == Key::Enter {
					value.write().clear();
				}
			},
		}
	}
}
```

Each component accepts function arguments (props)

* Props must be owned values, not references. Use `String` and `Vec<T>` instead of `&str` or `&[T]`.
* Props must implement `PartialEq` and `Clone`.
* To make props reactive and copy, you can wrap the type in `ReadOnlySignal`. Any reactive state like memos and resources that read `ReadOnlySignal` props will automatically re-run when the prop changes.

# State

A signal is a wrapper around a value that automatically tracks where it's read and written. Changing a signal's value causes code that relies on the signal to rerun.

## Local State

The `use_signal` hook creates state that is local to a single component. You can call the signal like a function (e.g. `my_signal()`) to clone the value, or use `.read()` to get a reference. `.write()` gets a mutable reference to the value.

Use `use_memo` to create a memoized value that recalculates when its dependencies change. Memos are useful for expensive calculations that you don't want to repeat unnecessarily.

```rust
#[component]
fn Counter() -> Element {
	let mut count = use_signal(|| 0);
	let mut doubled = use_memo(move || count() * 2); // doubled will re-run when count changes because it reads the signal

	rsx! {
		h1 { "Count: {count}" } // Counter will re-render when count changes because it reads the signal
		h2 { "Doubled: {doubled}" }
		button {
			onclick: move |_| *count.write() += 1, // Writing to the signal rerenders Counter
			"Increment"
		}
		button {
			onclick: move |_| count.with_mut(|count| *count += 1), // use with_mut to mutate the signal
			"Increment with with_mut"
		}
	}
}
```

## Context API

The Context API allows you to share state down the component tree. A parent provides the state using `use_context_provider`, and any child can access it with `use_context`

```rust
#[component]
fn App() -> Element {
	let mut theme = use_signal(|| "light".to_string());
	use_context_provider(|| theme); // Provide a type to children
	rsx! { Child {} }
}

#[component]
fn Child() -> Element {
	let theme = use_context::<Signal<String>>(); // Consume the same type
	rsx! {
		div {
			"Current theme: {theme}"
		}
	}
}
```

# Async

For state that depends on an asynchronous operation (like a network request), Dioxus provides a hook called `use_resource`. This hook manages the lifecycle of the async task and provides the result to your component.

* The `use_resource` hook takes an `async` closure. It re-runs this closure whenever any signals it depends on (reads) are updated
* The `Resource` object returned can be in several states when read:
1. `None` if the resource is still loading
2. `Some(value)` if the resource has successfully loaded

```rust
let mut dog = use_resource(move || async move {
	// api request
});

match dog() {
	Some(dog_info) => rsx! { Dog { dog_info } },
	None => rsx! { "Loading..." },
}
```

## Server Functions

Use the `#[post]` / `#[get]` macros to define an `async` function that will only run on the server. On the server, this macro generates an API endpoint. On the client, it generates a function that makes an HTTP request to that endpoint.

```rust
#[post("/api/double/:path/&query")]
async fn double_server(number: i32, path: String, query: i32) -> Result<i32, ServerFnError> {
	tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(1)).await;
	Ok(number * 2)
}
```

## Hydration

Hydration is the process of making a server-rendered HTML page interactive on the client. The server sends the initial HTML, and then the client-side runs, attaches event listeners, and takes control of future rendering.

### Errors
The initial UI rendered by the component on the client must be identical to the UI rendered on the server.

* Use the `use_server_future` hook instead of `use_resource`. It runs the future on the server, serializes the result, and sends it to the client, ensuring the client has the data immediately for its first render.
* Any code that relies on browser-specific APIs (like accessing `localStorage`) must be run *after* hydration. Place this code inside a `use_effect` hook.

# SaaS structure and design system

- Keep application code simple, concise, and readable. Separate routes, layouts, pages, and shared components.
- Always use the official Dioxus Components: https://dioxuslabs.com/components.
- Preserve their default styles and the supplied theme. Never customize fonts, borders, colors, backgrounds, shadows, or component appearance.
- Load the official gallery global typography/body defaults from `assets/dioxus-base.css` alongside the component theme. These are design system defaults, not app customization. Keep them unchanged.
- Application CSS may only arrange the layout (position, dimensions, spacing, flex/grid). Do not override component styles or theme tokens.
- The application opens on Home. Its sidebar is on the left, with Home as its only navigation item and a clickable avatar/name profile card at the bottom.
- Login and Register use a separate authentication layout.
- Use the official dark theme on every page, including Login and Register. Set `data-theme="dark"` on the HTML template; do not redefine theme colors.
- Navigation actions outside the sidebar use the official Button Link variant, never an unstyled browser link.

# Development database and compatibility

- This application is not in production. There is no real or historical data to preserve.
- Never keep legacy code, compatibility shims, old schema support, or fallback implementations.
- Never create database migrations or use a migration runner, including SQLx migrations.
- `infra/schema.sql` is the single source of truth for creating the entire current schema.
- Edit that schema directly. When a schema change requires rebuilding the database, use `make reset` and discard all development data.
- Keep the project Makefile at the repository root. It may contain commands for the project in general.
- Keep infrastructure commands independent from the app. `make up` starts only Docker Compose services, never the backend or frontend.
- Use Dioxus 0.7 server functions for the API and SQLx only on the server. Authenticate protected endpoints on the server, not only in the UI.

# Type safety

- Always aim for the strongest practical type safety throughout the application, including database access, API payloads, state, and domain models.
- All application SQL queries must use SQLx's compile-time checked macros: `query!`, `query_as!`, or `query_scalar!` (and their file variants).
- Never use unchecked macros or runtime-only `sqlx::query`, `query_as`, or `query_scalar` for application queries. Do not bypass parameter, column type, or nullability checks.
- Use explicit structs and enums for meaningful domain concepts. Avoid stringly typed data, untyped JSON, and unnecessary casts or unwraps.
- Check SQLx queries directly against the running PostgreSQL database during compilation using `DATABASE_URL` from `.env`. Do not use offline query metadata or a `.sqlx` cache.
